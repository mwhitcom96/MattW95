	<div class="bg"><p>ONCE upon a time a wicked Earth Fairy went forth to see what mischief she could do. She flitted on and on until she came to a House Door. She had come to one of the homes where the good and useful House Fairies dwell. The Door was open, and she crept up to it slyly, and peered in. There she saw a great room, in perfect order, for the House Fairies had put everything to rights before they went away to their tasks upstairs. The floor was swept, the pictures hung trim and straight upon the walls, the chairs were dusted and set about invitingly,[6] and on the Hearth the Fire burned warm and clear.</p></div>
