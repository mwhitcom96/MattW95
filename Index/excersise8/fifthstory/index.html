That book was made by Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly.  There was things which he stretched, but mainly he told the truth.  That is nothing.  I never seen anybody but lied one time or another, without it was Aunt Polly, or the widow, or maybe Mary.  Aunt Polly&ndash;Tom&rsquo;s Aunt Polly, she is&ndash;and Mary, and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book, which is mostly a true book, with some stretchers, as I said before.</p></div>
