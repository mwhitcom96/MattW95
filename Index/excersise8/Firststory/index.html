	<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
	<div><p>It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.

However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.

&ldquo;My dear Mr. Bennet,&rdquo; said his lady to him one day, &ldquo;have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?&rdquo;

Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.

&ldquo;But it is,&rdquo; returned she; &ldquo;for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it.&rdquo;</p></div>
