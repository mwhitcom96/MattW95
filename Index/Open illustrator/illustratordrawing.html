		<h1>Drawing Instructions</h1>
		<p>First make a canvous that is 8.5 x 11in</p>
		<p>If you dont have the ruler turned on, then you will need to check it.</p>
		<p>You can do this by going to view/rulers/show rulers.</p>
		<p>Starting the drawing you frist want to get the eclips tool, it should be where the rectangle tool is.</p>
		<p>Once you have that you should put your mouse at a inch and a half and drag down till the circle is a inch in diamitor.</p>
		<p>Next draw a line with the pencil tool straight down that goes down 1 inch.</p>
		<p>Lastly draw another line again with the pencil tool extending diagnoly a half an inch away from the circle and the line.</p>
		<p>Now you should have a terrible looking character that wasnt fininshed in 2mins cuz I was messing up a lot and hardly got anything done, and what I got done is still not good, but hopefully yours looks better then mine.</p>
		<p>Once done upload the file to matt_whitcomb@yahoo.com</p>
